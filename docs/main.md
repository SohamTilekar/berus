# Berus Browser Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Berus Browser project!

This document provides an overview of the Berus browser, its architecture, and the specific HTML tags and CSS properties that are currently supported.

Berus is a simple web browser built in Rust, aiming to render basic web content. As a work in progress, it has limited support for web standards compared to mainstream browsers. This documentation serves as a guide to the features that have been implemented.

Use the navigation (if available in the viewer) or the links within the README to explore specific topics like supported HTML tags and CSS properties.

Thank you for your interest in Berus!
